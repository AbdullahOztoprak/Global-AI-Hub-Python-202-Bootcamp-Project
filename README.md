# üìö Library Management System

A complete library management system with both CLI and REST API interfaces. Add books by ISBN, manage your collection, and access data through a web API.

Created as part of the Global AI Hub Python 202 Bootcamp to practice OOP, API integration and FastAPI development.

## üéØ Features

- Add books by ISBN with automatic title and author fetching from Open Library
- Manage your collection: add, remove, list, and search books
- Two interfaces: command line application and web API
- Persistent storage with SQLite database (no more JSON file!)
- Complete test suite with pytest

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdullahOztoprak/Global-AI-Hub-Python-202-Bootcamp-Project.git
cd Global-AI-Hub-Python-202-Bootcamp-Project
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Command Line Interface
```bash
python main.py
```
Follow the menu options to manage your library. Try adding a book with ISBN: `978-0439023528`

### Web API Server
```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs in your browser for interactive API documentation.

### Web Frontend
After starting the API server, open the web interface:

1. Go to the `web` folder in your project directory.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click ‚Üí Open with browser).
3. Use the interface to add, update, and delete books. All actions are synced with your FastAPI backend.

**Note:** The web frontend uses modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript and fetches data from your API at `http://localhost:8000`.


## üìã API Endpoints

- `GET /books` - List all books in the library
- `POST /books` - Add a new book by ISBN
- `PUT /books/{isbn}` - Update book details (title and/or author)
- `DELETE /books/{isbn}` - Remove a book from the library


### Example API Usage
```json
POST /books
{
  "isbn": "978-0439023528"
}

PUT /books/978-0439023528
{
  "title": "New Title",
  "author": "New Author"
}
```

## üß™ Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
python -m pytest
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
python -m pytest --cov
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3.12+
- FastAPI for REST API
- httpx for HTTP requests
- Pydantic for data validation
- pytest for testing
- SQLite for persistent storage
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for web frontend
